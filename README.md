# Art Generation through Neural Style Transfer using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks
Neural Style Transfer (NST) is one of the most fun techniques in deep learning. As seen in the project, it merges two images, namely, a "content" image (C) and a "style" image (S), to create a "generated" image (G). The generated image G combines the "content" of the image C with the "style" of image S. 

In this example, I am going to generate an image of the Louvre museum in Paris (content image C), mixed with a painting by Claude Monet, a leader of the impressionist movement (style image S).
